# LNIFT
This is my own implementation of the paper LNIFT: Locally Normalized Image For Rotation Multimodal Feature Matching.
by Jiayuan Li et al.
This is one of the attempt for feature matching between multimodal images. Images are normalised by local normalised filter. Feature matching is done on those images.
